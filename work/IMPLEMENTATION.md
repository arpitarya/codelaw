# IMPLEMENTATION — what has landed

A row is earned by **landing**, never by being planned. The queue reconciles
against this file before an item may be closed
([SR-WORK-OPEN-QUEUE](../records/0051_WORK-open-queue.md) rule 9). Newest first.

| date | item | what landed | outcome | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-18 | — | law L2: every dependency free, open source and permissive (SR-LAW-2) | accepted on the decider's ruling | `records/0004_LAW-2-foss-dependencies.md` |
| 2026-10-18 | — | the work system: records 0001–0003, 0051–0060; `work/`; `archive/`; hooks; the commit guard | set up | the setup commit |
